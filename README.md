# Science Dynamics Model
This repository contains the code for is based upon [this Social Dynamics of Science Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01069) which modeled the birth and decline of scientific disciplines. 

## Brief Explanation
At every time step, new authors and papers are added to the network. Each paper has a certain number of topics associated with it. An author's discipline corresponds to the topics that contain the most papers for the given author.

## Running the model


## Organization

## Data Structures
Within the model, there are existing data structures that are updated for **Authors**, **Papers**, and **Topics**. 
**Authors** will be stored in the ScholarNetwork data structure itself, with the following format:
```
{
    TopicID1: [PaperIDs],
    TopicID2: [PaperIDs],
}
```

**Papers** will be stored in the *Evolution* class with the following format:

```
{
    PaperID1: ([TopicIDs], [AuthorIDs]),
    PaperID2: ([TopicIDs], [AuthorIDs]),
}
```

**Topics** will also be stored in the *Evolution* class with the following format:
```
{
    TopicID1: [PaperIDs],
    TopicID2: [PaperIDs]
}
```

## Interactive Network Visualizations
Interective network visualizations can be generated by [Pyvis](https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) using the `ScholarNetwork.plotPyvisGraph()` method. Using [these Pyvis properties](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/nodes.html ), the nodes will be scaled to represent how many papers the author has published.
    
Todo: Edges with thickness for how many they have done together

## Dependencies
