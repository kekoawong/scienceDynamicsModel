# Science Dynamics Model
This repository contains a model based upon [this Social Dynamics of Science Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01069) which modeled the birth and decline of scientific disciplines.

## Brief Explanation
At every time step, new authors and papers are added to the network. Each paper has a certain number of topics associated with it. An author's discipline corresponds to the topics that contain the most papers for the given author.

## Running the Model
Reference **main.py** to see how to declare an instance of the **Evolution** class and run a model. With the default parameters, a model can be run and saved with the following code:
```
from modules.Evolution import Evolution

env = Evolution()
env.evolve(timeSteps=10)
env.saveEvolutionWithPickle('outputs/evolution.env')
```

The evolve method determines how many time steps to run the model. Then, the saved **Evolution** class can be loaded into a Jupyter Notebook, where the network visualizations can be viewed.

To run the base model (from the original paper) instead of the new model implemented in this paper, simply add the argument baseModel=True in the evolve method:
```env.evolve(timeSteps=10, baseModel=True)```

## Organization
* **modules**: Contains the main classes for the models
    * **Evolution.py**: contains the main model class that defines how the scientific collaboration evolves over time.
    * **ScholarNetwork.py**: contains the scholar network class, which extends from the `networkx.Graph` class.
    * **Author.py**: class that defines an authors node.
    * **Paper.py**: class that contains data and methods for papers, expanding the base model.
    * **Topic.py**: class that contains data and methods for topics, expanding the base model.
    * **Type.py**: class that contains the data and methods for types, introduced in this new model.
    * **HTMLPage.py**: class that extends the Evolution class to generate an HTML page with the corresponding outputs. Not an essential class for the model, just useful for visualizing outputs in one place.
* **outputs**: Contains example **Evolution** data structures, **ScholarNetworks**, and network visualizations from models that have been run. 
* **main.py**: Example python script that declares an instance of an science evolution model and runs it.
* **modelReplication.py**: Example script that uses multithreading to run multiple models, combining their data and generating plots at the end using the HTMLPage class.
* **viewEvolution.ipynb**: Example python notebook that shows the output of various evolution models.

## Interactive Network Visualizations
Interactive network visualizations can be generated by [Pyvis](https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) using the `ScholarNetwork.plotPyvisGraph()` method. Using [these Pyvis properties](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/nodes.html ), the nodes will be scaled to represent how many papers the author has published.
